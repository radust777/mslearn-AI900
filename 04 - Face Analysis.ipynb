One way to accomplish this is to perform facial detection and analysis - in other words, determine if there are any faces in the images, and if so analyze their features.\n","\n","![A robot analyzing a face](./images/face_analysis.jpg)\n","\n","## Use the Face cognitive service to detect faces\n","\n","Suppose the smart store system that Northwind Traders wants to create needs to be able to detect customers and analyze their facial features.
